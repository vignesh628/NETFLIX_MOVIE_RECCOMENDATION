# NETFLIX_MOVIE_RECCOMENDATION
This project aims to build a movie recommendation mechanism within Netflix. The dataset I used here come directly from Netflix. It consists of 4 text data files, each file contains over 20M rows, i.e. over 4K movies and 400K customers. All together over 17K movies and 500K+ customers!


One of the major challenges is to get all these data loaded into the Kernel for analysis, I have encountered many times of Kernel running out of memory and tried many different ways of how to do it more efficiently.
